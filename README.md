This is assestmen task given by "Automative by Napa"


I have implemented this project's on Texture framework (implemented by Facebook). Telegram used this framework to build UI. The project consists of two modules: Calls and Account Details, and two SPMs: SSignalKit and TelegramNetwork. 

### SSignalKit
SSignalKit is developed by Telegram developers.

### TelegramNetwork
I seperated network part from main project. This module consists of all data related to the Network side of the app. Added unit tests to test network services. All tests are implemented on XCTTest framework.
